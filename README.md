Warmup

Build the simple User Input Word Counter tutorial from Codecademy.

Project 1: Caesar Cipher

From Wikipedia:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

There's a brief video about it from Harvard's CS50 class.

Your Task
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

Project 2: Stock Picker

Your Task
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

Project 3: Substrings

Your Task
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words
